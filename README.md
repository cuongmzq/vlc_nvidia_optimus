Run VLC with dedicated GPU on my laptop

1. Open VLC folder and rename vlc.exe to vlc2.exe
2. Make vlc2.exe run with Dedicated GPU in Nvidia Control Panel
3. Copy vlc.exe taken from your build or download from Release section to VLC directory (replace original vlc.exe)
4. Enjoy
5. If it not working, then check and edit the path in vlc_cmd_option.txt. You may want to set default Video Player to VLC again.
